You're a poor farmer in the kingdom of getRandomName
A dragon has been terrorizing getRandomName for a while now.
So you, as the hero that you are, have decided to put an end this drama!
You’ve given up the noble profession of farming to become a:
Type 1 for warrior
Type 2 for mage
Type 3 for rogue
You know that as a level one getKlasse you won’t be able to face this dragon for sure,
so before challenging the dragon you must train.
You know there are goblin’s roaming the land and perhaps other creatures.
To fill your days you can track creatures or sleep to regain strength.
Don’t waste too much time because the dragon will just keep on terrorizing!
